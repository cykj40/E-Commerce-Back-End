  ## About
  
  ```md
  This assigment really does show us the students how valuable sequelize actually is. The command line displayed the code it wrote in sql language and it was a lot and   it was all stuff I would have had to write myself if I wasnt using sequelize. Sequelize has it's own complexities but once you get used to it, it's obviuosly the       better way to go since we have been learning javascript all along.
  ```

  ## User Story
  
  ```md
  AS A manager at an internet retail company
  I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
  SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  
  ```md
  GIVEN a functional Express.js API
  WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
  THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
  WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
  THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
  WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
  THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
  WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
  THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
  WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
  THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
  ```

  I dont think you can install it without my mysql password. The only thing you could do is contact me 
  and have me make one for you, for $$ or Join the Rutgers Coding   Bootcamp and they will teach you how to 
  make one, as well as many other cool things. check out the link below.
